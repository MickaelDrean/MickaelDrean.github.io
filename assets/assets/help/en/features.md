## Sessions
To access the page for managing sessions, click on the main menu ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/MainMenu.png)(at the top left), then on **Sessions**.
A list of sessions is then displayed.
By default, this list contains all your sessions, but you can filter the displayed sessions either by search (see ***Searching in sessions***), or by advanced filters (see ***Filtering sessions***)
The order of the sessions on the screen can be modified by sorting them in ascending or descending order of:
- Session date,
- Last modification date,
- Session name,
- Creation date.

### Create a session
To create a new session, click on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationCreateSessionButton.png) located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen.
Give your session a name and the date on which it will take place.
You can add a theme for this session:
- Your intention,
- The theoretical elements you wish to develop as an introduction to this session.

### Load a session
You can load a session created by another facilitator by clicking on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationLoadSessionButton.png) located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen.
Then select the session file you wish to import (a file with the extension *.vab*).

### View progress between sessions
By clicking on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationHorizontalSessionNavigationButton.png) (located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen), you access a horizontal view of the sessions.
In this view, each session is represented by a column with:
- The session title,
- Its date,
- The list of all exercises in the session.
In the session where an exercise is proposed for the first time, its name appears in color.
A click on the title of a session opens a window that displays:
- The session theme,
- Any observations noted after the session.

### Filter sessions
By clicking on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationAdvancedFilterButton.png) (located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen), you can activate or deactivate the filtering of the displayed sessions.
Filtering can be done:
- by date: filtering sessions between two dates,
- by the presence or absence of observations: filtering sessions containing observations.

### Export sessions to text format (CSV)
You remain the owner of your data.
At any time, you can retrieve your sessions in an open text format (CSV) by clicking on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationExportToCSVButton.png) (located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen).
This allows you to reimport your sessions into another application than VivenciApp or to generate playlists for applications like VLC, Windows Media Player, Clementine, or iTunes for your sessions.

### Features available for each session

## Session Editing / Animation

### Session Editing
The editing mode primarily allows you to create your session by adding, modifying, or deleting propositions (exercise-music associations), and to write your own instructions for each proposition, optionally starting from parts of the catalog instructions for that exercise.
It also allows you to modify the session's title, date, and theme. 

In editing mode you can:
- **Edit the session title** by clicking on the title text visible at the top right of the window. 
 ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionEditionTitleEditor.png)

![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionEditionOnCurve.png)

## Editing a proposition
From the **editing/animation** mode or the **editing on the curve** mode, you can create or modify your *propositions*, meaning your associations between an exercise and a piece of music.

![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/PropositionEditionWidget.png)

### The three modes for creating a proposition
The proposition editing window provides access to three complementary modes:
 - **I explore** to seek inspiration by browsing the catalog loaded into VivenciApp,
 - **I act** when you know which exercise you want to select by typing a few letters of the exercise name you are looking for to reduce the displayed list,
 - **I refine** when your session is already partially built and you want to fine-tune the musical flow between your propositions

### Explore
To navigate through the catalog in search of an exercise and/or an association of an exercise with a piece of music, click on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/PropositionEditionExplorationButton.png) located on the left of the proposition editing box.
The catalog then opens and allows you to search by exercise or by music (see the **Catalog Exploration** chapter).

### Act
To quickly select an exercise whose name you know, simply type the first letters or even a sequence of letters contained in the name of that exercise. A reduced list of selectable exercises is displayed, in which you can click to select the desired exercise.
![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/PropositionEditionAutocompletion.png)
Once the exercise is selected, you can repeat the same operation to select the music you wish to associate with this exercise in your session.

### Refine
To allow you to refine the fluidity of your musical choices, click on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/PropositionEditionRefineButton.png) located on the right of the music input/selection line.

The window that opens then allows you to:
 - see the previous proposition and listen to its music
 - see the next proposition and listen to its music
 - chain the listening of the previous music with a possible music for the proposition to refine,
 - chain the listening of a possible music for the proposition to refine with the next music,
 - pre-select a few potential alternatives for the proposition to refine before chaining again:
 - play the previous music,
 - play the alternative I'm hesitating about,
 - play the next music.

Step by step, you can eliminate alternatives until you keep the music that flows best between the previous and the next one.

![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/RefineMusic.png)

### Editing the proposition's instructions
To draft the instruction elements that you will use to present the proposition to the participants, you have the option to copy sections from the catalog's instructions and to modify and enrich them.
The sections available in the catalog for the selected exercise are colored. A click on the title of one of the sections copies the content of that section into the instruction editing field for the proposition.
