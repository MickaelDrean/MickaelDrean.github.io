### Import a session
You can import a session created by another facilitator by clicking on the button ![Import session button](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationLoadSessionButton.png) located in the top-right banner.

Select the session file to import (*.vab*).

You can also import a session by double-clicking directly on the *.vab* file.

If a session with the same name already exists in VivenciApp, you can:

## Editing a proposal
From **editing/animation mode** or **curve editing mode**, you can create or modify your *proposals*, meaning your exercise–music associations.

![Proposal editing](assets/help/en/images/PropositionEditionWidget.png)

### The three modes for creating a proposal
The proposal editing window provides three complementary modes:
- **I explore** to find inspiration by browsing the catalog
- **I act** when you know which exercise you want to select by typing part of its name
- **I refine** when your session is already partially built and you want to fine-tune musical transitions

### Explore
To browse the catalog in search of an exercise or an exercise–music association, click on the button  
![Explore button](assets/help/en/images/PropositionEditionExplorationButton.png)  
located on the left of the proposal editing box.

### Act
To quickly select a known exercise, type the first letters (or any sequence of letters) contained in its name.
A reduced list of selectable exercises appears.

![Autocompletion](assets/help/en/images/PropositionEditionAutocompletion.png)

Once the exercise is selected, repeat the operation to select the music to associate with it.

### Refine
To refine the musical flow, click on the button  
![Refine button](assets/help/en/images/PropositionEditionRefineButton.png)

The window allows you to:
- listen to the previous and next proposals,
- chain listening between alternatives,
- progressively eliminate options until the best transition is found.

![Refine music](assets/help/en/images/RefineMusic.png)

### Editing the proposal’s instructions
To write the instructions you will use with participants, you can copy sections from the catalog instructions and adapt them.
Available catalog sections are color-coded. Clicking on a section title copies its content into the proposal instruction field.

![Copy catalog instructions](assets/help/en/images/PropositioneditionInstructions.png)
