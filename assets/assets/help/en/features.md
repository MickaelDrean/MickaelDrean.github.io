## Sessions
To access the page for managing sessions, click on the main menu ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/MainMenu.png)(at the top left), then on **Sessions**.
A list of sessions is then displayed.
By default, this list contains all your sessions, but you can filter the displayed sessions either by search (see ***Searching in sessions***) or by advanced filters (see ***Filtering sessions***).
The order of the sessions on the screen can be modified by sorting them in ascending or descending order by:
- Session date,
- Last modification date,
- Session name,
- Creation date.

### Create a session
To create a new session, click on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationCreateSessionButton.png) located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen.
Give your session a name and the date on which it will take place.
You can add a theme for this session:
- Your intention,
- The theoretical elements you wish to develop as an introduction to this session.

### Load a session
You can load a session created by another facilitator by clicking on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationLoadSessionButton.png) located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen.
Then select the session file you wish to import (a file with the extension *.vab*).

### View progress between sessions
By clicking on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationHorizontalSessionNavigationButton.png) (located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen), you access a horizontal view of the sessions.
In this view, each session is represented by a column with:

In the session where an exercise is proposed for the first time, its name appears in color.
A click on the title of a session opens a window that displays:

### Filter sessions
By clicking on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationAdvancedFilterButton.png) (located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen), you can activate or deactivate the filtering of the displayed sessions.
Filtering can be done:

At any time, you can retrieve your sessions in an open text format (CSV) by clicking on the button ![screenshot1](assets/help/en/images/SessionExplorationExportToCSVButton.png) (located in the top right banner of the session exploration screen).
This allows you to reimport your sessions into another application than VivenciApp or to generate iTunes playlists for your sessions.
