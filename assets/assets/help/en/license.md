# License Management

The license is tied to a specific workstation (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
By default, the license has a duration of one year.
It may be shorter when activated during the methodology year.

The software allows you to:
- Display the license status (invalid, valid, or expiring in X months starting from 2 months before expiration)
- Update the license key

## License Types

There are several types of licenses, each offering different features according to your needs:
- **Student**: license during the methodology year mainly to discover the catalog provided by your school, build and animate your first sessions within this framework.
- **Under supervision**: license that allows you to build and animate your sessions, note your observations on participants, and pay attention to progression between sessions.
- **Graduated**: license that additionally allows you to add your own exercises and music.
- **Supervisor**: license that allows you to import sessions from facilitators you supervise, and create catalogs.
