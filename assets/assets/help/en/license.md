# License Management

The license is tied to a specific workstation (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
By default, the license has a duration of one year.
It may be shorter when activated during the methodology year.

The software allows you to:
- Display the license status (invalid, valid, or expiring in X months starting from 2 months before expiration)
- Update the license key

## License Types

There are several types of licenses available, each offering different features depending on your needs.
