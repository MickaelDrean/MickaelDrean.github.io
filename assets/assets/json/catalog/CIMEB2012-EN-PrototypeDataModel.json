What we're trying to rehabilitate in Biodanza is the natural communication that takes place between two people through their gaze, enabling them to re-establish the bridges that make it a true opening to essential perception. From being a simple 'objective' perception of things in the world, it becomes a binding force.",
            "One of the first approaches will be to facilitate both playful, spontaneous communication situations and situations that dissolve the tensions linked to the difficulty of being sincere. So, for this last part, we will be relying on segmental movements, on the intimate connection with oneself, and on everything linked to the expression of emotions: motor integration, affective-motor integration and communication. But we don't have to put the emphasis on eye contact, which would only make things more difficult."

Through the interstices, in a sensitive dance, their eyes are looking, and the bodies sometimes approach and sometimes move apart. Gradually, as confidence comes through the connection, the hands move apart revealing more of the face and the eyes, until a total \"unveiling\". Participants will then contemplate each-other in their entirety and find a way to establish a harmonious dialogue in which they can hug or dance together (by introducing elements of creativity while maintaining the connection through the eyes)."

As a result there is an increased flexibility in communication and the disposition toward resolving conflicts when they occur. There is also an improvement in the reciprocal adaptation of the bodies during the sexual act.",

Water chemically dissolves salt, creating a solution. People who symbolically have a great deal of water as a personal characteristic, which means they have fluidity, have a better capacity for resolving problems."

            "The dialogue that develops between two people when in contact or when they touch is made up of various elements among which the perception of tonicity is essential. Tonicity may be light and guide the dialogue toward gentleness, it can be heavy and make the dialogue intense, or it can be powerful and moving towards some sort of confrontation. The degree of tonus informs us each of the emotional, psychological and relational orientation of the relation that takes place. Opposition is one of the many facets of the encounter in the relationship to another: it provides information on the divergence of positions and on the determination that a person may have to assert his own position. Opposition is harmonious when it opens the door to dialogue, allowing to establish a eutonic symmetrical pulsation: everyone is understood in what he has to express, even with force, and nobody is animated by a desire to negate the other. The ability to experience a vivencia of opposition without breaking the dialogue nourishes mature affectivity.",
            "In every relationship between two healthy, strong and assumed identities, there are times when we oppose.",
            "Our ability to live these moments with serenity is part of the recognition of our own dignity and that of the other. This capacity disarms the violence generated through the frustration of not knowing how to position ourselves. This dance is somehow the \"yang\" version of the \"Dance of eutony of the hands\". Here, both are in contact with their own strength, but it is not intended to undermine the other. They both harmonize the encounter of their respective powers through tonicity."

The accompanying person is behind with the palms of her hands resting gently on the partner's forearms, near the hands. The hand's contact should not weigh but establish a real contact which is light and does not limit or imprisons, while not being a caressing of the arms either. When the music starts, the person dancing begins to realize a pulsating movement of openness and connection to oneself, then gradually abandons this regular pulse in order to blend in with his dance, with the intimate perception of a total continuity between the impulses coming from the chest and the movement of the arms in response. The movements are slow and delicate, with light tonicity. The accompanying person, by empathy, becomes the perfect double of this movement by following with his entire body.",
            "As in the previous exercises, at the end of the music and after a moment during which the person can slightly lean back (as if receiving a hug from behind) and lay his head on the shoulder of the companion, he will be received in a frontal embrace before proceeding to the reciprocity of the exchange."

This exercise is to be proposed preferably during the regressive phase of the session of Biodanza, and more preferably so in a group that already has the conditions of vivencial deepening. This is so that the exercise can achieve a deeper level of affective-sexual intensity and intimacy.",

            "When it is done standing, one person moves to the center between its two partners, on a stable position with feet parallel, knees slightly bent, eyes closed, and the mouth, neck, shoulders and arms relaxed in a receptive position. The other two partners begin to caress her all over the body very sensitively, with delicate touch and a lot of tenderness. They alternate a consistent quality of touch with shades of lightness or sensitivity. First, a secure touch offered by a gentle pressure on all parts of the body (the movements are soft and tender, without \"anatomical\" intentionality, and to and sensibilize the entirety of the body. This is the \"consistent\" or \"containing\" touch. Then, the second touch has a quality of undifferentiated tenderness by which the caresses generate a sense of dissolution and unification of different body parts. A tenderness that invites the person to melt and accept the gift of \"receiving\". Both partners then caress the person freely, taking care to \"distribute\" their touch over the entire surface of the body, including legs, feet and arms, and taking care not to focus both on the same body areas. It is important that the person being caressed has the feeling of being protected and not \"fragmented\" if certain body parts are \"abandoned\". Therefore, for example, when one partner is dedicated to the upper body the other takes care of the bottom, and then very fluidly they alternate their positions and caresses.",
            "These caresses can open a very important door to bodily sensations of pleasure and deep eroticism (deep as in integrated with affectivity). These erotic vivencias of sensitive and affective-sexual integration can create the conditions for a renewed state of being at peace with and have a sort of reconciliation with one's body. The experience of one's own body becomes an experience of pleasure and eroticism, which may result in neurophysiological healing responses. We can identify the experience as \"the love that heals\" in the affective domain as well as in sensuality, sexuality and eroticism.",
            "Consider that in the standing situation the regression will be reduced compared to the lying down situation, which induces a more erotic vivencia for all participants, those offering the caresses and the recipient.",
            "Sometimes the person who is caressed into this level of affective-transcendent surrender has difficulty to stand. In this case, the two companions will help her down to the ground and continue to caress her until the music ends.",

          "Introduction": [
            "Shiva belongs to the trinity of Hindu gods integrated by Brahma, the creator, and Vishnu, the conserver of life. Shiva symbolises the eternal transformation of the universe, which consists of cyclical destruction and creation. He is the god of the dance and of transformation.",
            "The cosmic process is death and resurrection, eternal renewal of life. Within ourselves, the action of Shiva will be to die to our old body and be reborn to a new cycle of life. The dance of Shiva has as its theme cosmic activity, the eternal transformation.",
            "Ananda Coomaraswamy describes the five divine activities of Shiva:",
            "1. The continual creation of the Universe, originated in rhythm.",
            "2. Conservation, based in balance and moderation of movements.",
            "3. Destruction of the forms that have been overcome, through the inner fire.",
            "4. The eternal renewal.",
            "5. The incarnation of life.",
            "The God of the Dance, Shiva Nataraja, is at the same time the God of Changes, which implies that changes are induced by dance.",
            "Shiva is represented with his right foot crushing a demon, which symbolises victory over the demonic fires of destruction, and his left foot in the air, representing balance and the impulse toward ascension. The image of Shiva has four arms, with which he achieves the cyclical creation and destruction of the world. A circle of fire surrounds him. The Dance of Shiva is, therefore, a movement that destroys in order to generate the process of creation.",
            "Inspired by the Dances of Shiva and their symbolism of transformation, Rolando Toro Araneda created the “Dance of Transformation,” which has three essential attributes of movement: unity, balance and harmony.",
            "Unity: means that the entire body moves in perfect coordination, integrating its parts and connecting with all that lives. From the psychomotor point of view, this requires an integration of pyramidal and extra-pyramidal pathways.",
            "Balance: raises the demand of movement in relation with the earth’s force of gravity, readjusting postural structure in every moment. All the variations take place in unstable balance on one leg, which requires the integration of the receptors of balance of the inner ear with the cortical-cerebral structures.",
            "Harmony: means that the movements should be made in perfect fusion with the music, giving the body the pulsation of life.",
            "In the learning stage, this integrates the sensory-motor, auditory, visual and vestibular structures. In more advanced stages, this produces amplified states of consciousness, due to the intense process of integration that is induced.",
            "Once the archetypal pattern is established, the Dance of Transformation proposed in Biodanza includes displacement through space, with great richness of variations, creativity and harmony.",
            "The symbolism of the Dance of Transformation suggests the destruction of the old rigid and repressed body, in order to reconcile in a new body, tender and free. One cannot have change if there is no destruction or transformation of the past.",
            "The value of the three absolutes of movement (unity, balance and harmony) is not only in terms of motor integration. There is a process of transcendence in this dance that integrates highly differentiated levels, which has a metaphysical-existential resonance:",
            "Unity: The entire body is in action. No dissociation is possible. The vital energy flows, reinforcing the dynamic stability of the organism.",
            "Balance: This is not only a labyrinth-cerebellum function, but is also psychic: equilibrium before distinct options or temptations of change. There are always possible changes of place, of work, of love, etc. Within these magnetic polarities, each one must be connected with his or her center. This quality of existential balance emerges from the resonance within a center of inner balance.",
            "Harmony: This is the perfect relationship in feedback. Harmony is the connection of stimulus-response to all of the outer world in such a way that the inner world palpitates in resonance, until the barrier between the outer and the inner disappears.",
            "If we embody these three essential characteristics, we initiate a new stage of existential renewal. When carried out with great training, this dance activates not only the cortical, motor and sensory areas and pathways, but also the limbic centers related to cosmic consciousness."

            "The dance is done in pairs. One of two people closes her eyes and, in a relaxed position, remains passive and in a state of extreme sensitivity. The other is active: he touches lightly and with great delicacy different parts of the partner's body, who responds to these delicate \"stimuli\" by a substantial movement of the body part that has been touched. And thus gradually emerges a sensitive dance in response to the received stimulations and in harmony with them. For example, if she feels her hand being touched, moves it with the utmost sensitivity.",

            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Since the dawn of history to the present, the movement and gesture vocabulary of humanity is impregnated with \"postures\" and gestures which have an eternal character.",
            "These archetypal gestures are found on the reliefs of churches and other temples, in sculptures, paintings and frescoes across all cultures and all civilizations, and across all times. They are gestures and acts of worship, maternity, reverence, labor or intimacy.",
            "Rudolf von Laban hypothesized that the movements of dance are the movements of life and founded a movement based on this principle.",
            "Etienne Decroux - creator of Dramatic Body Mime - has selected 22 basic positions that are the basis for the gestures of the traditional art of mime.",
            "For Biodanza I selected three codes - or groups - of Generative Postures, of which the different possible combinations give rise to spontaneous dances of great richness and reveal the wealth of human depth.",
            "Each one of these postures contains a deep psychological and symbolic meaning.",
            "The archetypal gestures belong to the collective unconscious as described by Carl G. Jung and are true matrixes of human expressivity. The three codes of Generative Postures that I present in Biodanza are the product of an extensive research conducted around the gestural repertoire of different cultures: Hindu, Egyptian, Greco-Roman, to name just a few. I selected those that seem to represent highly evolved forms - capable of inducing profound and transcendent vivencias - and which have the power to generate \"eternal dances.\"",
            "I have called these archetypal gestures \"generative postures\" because they have the potential of generating specific dances.",
            "(NDT: in Methodology II, Rolando Toro describes specific dances as being those which permit the expression of genetic potentials)",
            "The usual expressive dance (let's say, common) is a combination of movements organized from the personal emotion of the dancer. The dances that arise from the combination of generative postures have a more universal dimension and hint at the greatness of the human being. The combination of three or more Generative Postures results in dances of extraordinary beauty which are endowed with great expressive force.",
            "The completion of each Generative Posture should last about one minute, following which the facilitator invites the participants to do a free dance, creating their own variations on the archetypal matrix, that is to say, from the Generative Posture itself.",
            "The basic posture of almost all the Generative Postures is the Posture of Identity, from which we begin and to which we return. Legs are separated to the width of our hips, head on shoulders, standing straight, arms relaxed.",
            "The division into three separate Codes also refers to the growing vivencial capacity of the dancer. Indeed, a vivencial immaturity does not allow full access to the objectives of the Generative Postures of Code II or III.",

In his approach of transcendence, he invites us into intimacy with order at the center of the undifferentiated, of the uncreated, of the unknown… of everything which our limited perception is uncapable of seeing but nevertheless exists. Our path of humanity is in our capacity to find order and harmony in every situation, in our capacity to find the courage to become intimate with the Chaos.

            "I can only feel as One with the cosmos when I open myself to it. The movement does not stop at the fingertips, but it extends beyond. In the dance that follows the posture and invites for variations, we can move and turn in large movements of expansion, upwards and on the sides. However, one must be careful not to close the fists again, even if one goes back into moments of connection to oneself. This position's essential existential objective is the opening and expansion of identity. A cosmic identity."

            "This is a \"timeless\" vivencia where time is freed of any measure. It is inspired on yoga, and the vivencia comes from the very subtle sensation of the concentration of energy carried out without any effort. For people who have difficulties, they should be invited to adapt to it to their motor possibilities (including doing it sitting on a chair). However, the demonstration by the facilitator must comply with the instructions. This posture is not followed by a dance."

The legs take a half-bent position to allow for the lifting of the pelvis in a pulsating movement, back and forth and rotating, referring to the movements of the sexual offering. These movements should not be mechanical but a response to an inner urge and impulse.",

            "This posture can help recovering the sacred meaning of femininity. The person who witnesses this surrender will also be connected to this sacredness, to the greatness of the mystery. When a man contemplates this, he gives thanks for the gift that was given for his eyes to see: the deep femininity of his female companions.",

However, it is performed with accompaniment: with protection and especially with the stimulation offered by the other. It is a companion that stimulates the emergence to life with delicate stimulation and orientation, by caresses and by a very sensitive touch.",
            "The person (the dancer) is placed on the ground in a semi-fetal position (different from the initial position of the dance of the seed, which is kneeling and bent on oneself and in a position of deep connection to the visceral forces that will make possible and natural the ascending expansion that will follow).",
            "In the Dance of Eclosion to life, the position is semi-fetal because it is the presence and stimulation offered by the other (the caregiver) that constitutes the inductive force of the deployment. Forces that do not come from us but from the receptivity to the affective stimuli of the world. Thus, the person who wants to hatch and start his eclosion leaves somewhat behind her own impulses and tendencies to grow by herself. She is not passive but receptive. So she lets herself be carried by the intrinsic strengths of birth and expansion in their encounter with the world.",
            "The caregiver begins to touch the person with care and very delicate movements, sending him his warmth, his touch, his presence. He seeks to enter in profound harmony with the dancer in order to facilitate the movement, which develops gradually until it unfolds and develops. He thus ensures that this deployment takes place in the continuity and fluidity of a natural sequence (like the blossoming of a flower).",
            "These delicate and caressing touches help give support and direction, helping to open and deploy to find the position of lying on her back and totally open, ready to be fertilized by air and light. Continuing to accompany with contact and caresses that give warmth and support, the helper aids with folding the legs (to prepare to get up) and is placed behind the dancer (behind his head) in order to lift the dancer to a sitting position, firmly supporting his back and head. Always through caresses and communicating assurance, the dancer is helped to his feet. In fact, by supporting, the caregiver is placed in position of tutoring giving containment to help the dancer to stand up. As soon as the dancer shows the first attempts to gradually open his eyes, the helper teaches him the first steps, stimulating him to walk, then to dance. To dance life. Then comes the crucial step of communicating the courage and the enchantment of dancing alone, to let go of the hand, to move away in order to dance his own life, not for the companion who helped him, but in the world and for the world."

In other religions, such as the Judeo-Christian Genesis, the origin of the world is the divine breath, the voice, the breath of life, the word that designates the name of these things, giving them identity and rescuing them from the chaos.",

            "Possibly these two lines represent the initial options of the drama of consciousness faced with the unfathomable mystery. Moreover, if we are conscious of the intuition of a primordial unity, the bifurcation of the corporal and spiritual makes no sense and will be better represented as an anthropological catastrophe:",

            "Nevertheless, all the cosmogonies start from a unique principle, which later unfolds into a duality, trinity or quaternity. This unique principle can be a solitary creator-god, an unnamed and unintelligible god, the primordial egg, the seed of life, etc. That is to say, it describes the process that goes from unity to diversity and which has been called “The Multiple Unity” by the philosophers. In the Egyptian cosmogony, the god Ra separates the brothers Nut and Geb, creating the space of life and the heavenly vault. In the East, the Tao is formed by the Ying-Yang duality.

In the sense of Teilhard de Chardin, creation will be evolutively perfected, from the simple to the complex, from the undifferentiated to the differentiated, while in the East this process is cyclic and represents the millennial succession of karmic revolutions. In Christianity, this process is linear and developed historically ending with “Parousia,” the return to God through the Final Judgement.",

This process, in our conception, does not unfold in a closed or linear cycle; it corresponds to an evolutive model in a logarithmic spiral. The universe, therefore, is perfected through successive processes of integration of vital circuits, each time more differentiated. The integrative mechanism is communal love, the connection with life."

            "Friendship is a feeling that leaves the other free. There is no jealousy between friends. There is a deep respect for what the other feels. But friendship is, as we see it, a complex feeling which deepens with time.",
            "Plato said: \"In friendship we must be careful not to let the misunderstanding settle and grow.\" That is to say, that we must learn to take care of our friend. As the Milton Nascimento song says, \"a friend is someone that is kept on the left side of the chest.\"",

In such cases, a disagreement appears which, in the dance, results in the confrontation of opposing forces (the forearms opposing each other).

In this case, the exercise consists of supporting the other’s weight on one's back, in an action that shouldn't be violent but very tender. Back to back, one member of the couple lies backwards on the other one supporting him. Then they change around. This stage must be made with precision and concentration. Whomever receives the weight can bend the legs and lean forward to keep the balance. The differences of character and temperament that exists between the two partners sometimes constitute an existential weight and so to support the other one needs a support of precision and affection.",

            "Lying down together the man lies on top of the woman. They can look into each other's eyes and exchange kisses. The genitals are in contact with each other. This position has the advantage of offering a more personal relationship. The woman can open the legs and also lift the pelvis up and expose the genitals. It is a posture of domination of the man over the woman. So the man must avoid leaning with all his weight on her. He has to use his strength and support himself. Together they develop a reciprocal caress towards the next posture.",
            "3 On de side, the man behind the woman",
            "This is a posture which is more anonymous and more instinctive and less personal. But the man comes into contact this time with the female gluteus.",
            "The possibility of also holding the breasts and masturbating her. Many women prefer this position rather than the frontal one because they can experience more sexual arousal and masturbate, or be masturbated by the man.",

            "Each person has their mouth close to each other’s genitals. It’s a very important as a position because it reveals the reciprocal confidence and trust; for them to totally accept shared genitality. This position is often very helpful to prepare for the orgasm and an excellent preparation for deep penetration.",

            "5 The woman on top",
            "The man lies down on his back and receives the woman who sits on his genitals. In this dominant position, the woman has the possibility of more freedom in her movements, without the oppressive weight of the man on top of her. Then she can conduce her own orgasm making her own wanted and necessary movements.",
            "Some women really like this position because it has an element of self-affirmation.",
            "6 Mixed position",
            "This is one of the most important positions. The woman lies down on her belly and bends the right leg. Then the man lies on top of her passing his left leg out or between her two legs. This position has these advantages:",
            "i)It is highly personalised because b they can face each other and the man has access to the breasts.",
            "The woman totally exposes her genitals. The man’s penetration is total and this exposes the virility of the man.",
            "ii)The man experiments with the contact he now has with her buttocks and also has access to her face and to her breasts.",
            "For these reasons it’s called the \"mixed posture\"",
            "7 Sideways face to face position",

          "Category": "SEQUENTIAL DANCES",
          "Introduction": [
            "The symbolic situation of the trance of suspension is that it can ritually recreate the conditions of the intrauterine gestation:",
            "The group represents the matrix: warm, safe, protective, in which the person finds himself in a situation of total dependence (and consequently in total trust) and where he fully delegates to his companions the responsibility of the most important expression of identity: the behaviors of vigilance for survival, and therefore all the biopsychological functions associated with them. The group takes all the initiatives that the person would take and realizes all acts that are normally the responsibility of our waking consciousness and our alertness needed for survival (balance, voluntary movement, environmental assessment by perception, decision making). This is what allows the person to surrender (a symbolic mother is caring) so that the functions that are activated are not those of vigilance, but those of metabolization and organic repair: indeed, in the womb, the baby receives everything it needs (heat, food, protection, stimulation) without having to anticipate his needs or to implement a strategy for its satisfaction.",
            "In this space, and in a very short period of time from a duration point of view, but a fully expanded period of time from the vivencia viewpoint, the person achieves a kind of ascent to the source of his own potential, to an earlier stage of its own development, mainly prior to the \"scratches\" due to the very process of confrontation of various difficulties and conditionings arising from being in the world. Being in the world requires adaptation (physiological, psychological, affective and behavioral). Although this adaptation has the effect of \"shaping\" the brain and enhancing the synaptic connections (without the other there is no identity), it generates multiple stressors from various sources that constitute what Rolando Toro calls \"negative ecofactors of development\". The regression induced by biodanza is then a kind of dedifferentiation compared to the ontogenetic process which, in itself, constitutes a process of evolutionary differentiation.",
            "In this \"going back to the source\" the person reconnects with the first vital source or plan, insofar as the conditions, both internal (the ability to surrender is not a challenge but a pleasure) and external (the accompanying quality of the group) are met.",
            "This is why the facilitator will be careful to create the conditions for what constitutes a ritual of rebirth. These conditions are not an attempt to create perfection: any requirement of perfection in the conditions, as much from the facilitator than from the group or the person who will have the proposed vivencia, is the expression of a sort of rigidity that will prevent the vivencia of surrender.",
            "It will then be sufficient to invite all participants to be present as best as they can, and facilitate for them, in the preparation vivencia, the awakening of innocence, lightness, acceptance, receptivity, intimacy, sensitivity, self-sacrifice, generosity and empathy.",
            "Therefore, it goes without saying that the exercise will be offered to groups that have already completed a process of initiation in Biodanza and have an important level of affective integration.",
            "Regarding the invitation to the person doing the trance, there are several alternatives:",
            " - It is a special day and the group \"offers\" the ceremony to the person (birthday, key existential moment). In this case, the person knows she will experience this trance of suspension and it is important that she agrees.",
            " - It is the normal process of the group and in this case, the facilitator keeps the center open to anyone who wishes to live this ceremony, explaining that only one person can live it. This is one more reason to ensure the affective integration of the group, since all will be required to take care of one, even if they wanted to be in his place. In this situation, the experience of those who compose the matrix should also be greatly enhanced and validated.",
            "In these first two cases, it is advisable to specify to the group that they should offer themselves to the ceremony, that it is not a challenge. Otherwise, fear is an almost certain barrier for surrender.",
            "This is a \"challenge\" in the Minotaur Project or in the Tree of Desires. In those cases, the facilitator knows which person will be called, on the basis of the survey and his own intuition. But the person must always have the possibility of accepting or refusing.",
            "The explanation is done in advance and all steps are described, even mimed if needed (the first time) so that the facilitator doesn't have to talk - or just very little - during the ceremony. If he has to, he will have a reassuring voice, soft and with containment. To avoid a demand for perfection, he may inform the person receiving the ceremony that everyone will do what they can, as best they can, and that the entire group demands tenderness for any imperfections in the accompaniment they may have. Indeed, some people do not fail to strengthen their low self-esteem, if the group manifest some clumsiness (\"it was inevitable that this falls on me…anyway, my mother was never able to take good care of me …\", etc.)",
            "Similarly, it should be noted that as in any exercise of Biodanza, this is a process and there is no need to judge the experience in terms of \"successful trance\", \"good trance \"or\" bad trance\". The person has absolutely no voluntary or conscious control over the depth of its surrender.",
            "The facilitator must ensure that the workplace is adequately protected in terms of privacy and there are no observers."

            "1 Creation of the matrix",
            "Forming the circle, people are holding by their waist, shoulder against shoulder. The circle is the embodiment of the matrix in which the person surrenders. It should be asked from people to ensure their stability, and to remove eyeglasses and any other jewelry that may cause discomfort.",
            "2 Surrender within the matrix",
            "Surrendering in the center of the uterus of the group: rotating on himself counterclockwise as so relying on the wall formed by the group. Symbolism: regression to the origin (going back in time). The facilitator enters the circle with the person and invites him with soft words to go back to the source of what inside him is in it most innocent, living, naturally healthy state. The modality of this rotation should be clear to the person beforehand. The legs are flexed, the mouth relaxed. The person may choose someone who will be the one to support his head; this choice can be made by the facilitator.",
            "3 Suspension and gyration",
            "Raise the person when her legs do not bear her any longer (by at least eight people) and do between 4 and 8 gyrations, always counterclockwise. Symbolism: going back to the origin of one' own life. This portage must be handled with sensitivity and confidence; it is therefore important that the facilitator designates those most capable of ensuring the quality of it. He should clearly indicate in advance the modality of the portage.",
            "The person's body should be straight without stiffness. His arms must rest on his stomach and not hang over the sides or be blocked by the carriers. The holding of the head should be done in a particularly sensitive manner. It should be said to the carriers to hold their backs straight so as not to convey too much of their own tensions. The gyrations are not too fast nor too slow. They may be followed by some rocking (longitudinal). The physiological effects are on the inner ear, with loss of spatiotemporal reference.",
            "4 Lying on the ground and formation of the cord",
            "Lay the person on the ground (if possible, on a mattress or blanket). Symbolically, this is the moment of rest, which stops any solicitation, any stimulation. It is important that the ground is not cold, which would stimulate micro tremors to warm the body. From the moment the person is lying on the ground, the people who form the matrix and maintain it formed throughout the ceremony also descend to the ground (they sit together in a circle, maintaining the link between them).",
            "5 Deepening of the trance",
            "The facilitator holds the hand of the person and also holds the circle, in a manner to hold the cord formed by the standing participants. Symbolism: the umbilical cord. Any experience of trance (travel) is associated with the symbol of psychopompos: that which ensures the link with \"the different worlds» and ensures the return. It is the thread of Ariane that allows Theseus to enter the maze, but especially the umbilical cord that connects the fetus to the mother and which therefore which ensures the nutrients it needs for survival within this matrix. It is during this phase that the person lives his trance (his journey towards the origin). One can observe the movements of his eyelids, the depth of his breathing and in some cases, a sort of slightly cold sweat in the palm of his hand (indicating a strong activity of the autonomous nervous system). It is a delicate phase. Indeed, if the facilitator observes a inversion of the experience, towards something unpleasant and which could become dissociating, he may abbreviate the vivencia by offering embraces, by putting the person in sitting position and by inviting him gently to open the eyes. This is why, early in the ceremony, it should be clarified that there is no result to be achieved and no success nor failure in this vivencia.",
            "6 Restore the identity with caresses",
            "Caresses of containment: caresses that give back the sensation of the body limit. Symbolism: slow, deep and enveloping contact prepares the person to feel his own bodily boundaries and thus to gradually \"recover\" identity. It is important to indicate not to place the hands on the face or sex. Indeed, the face is strongly linked to identity and applying contact at this point would cause a too rapid activation. The caresses on the sexual parts could induce a double message: because the person is treated like the baby and the companions represent the protective and mothering adult, fondling of a sexual kind could lead to vivencial confusion and activate the vigilance system. The person is not, at this time of the vivencia, able to assess the situation nor to act in reciprocal feedback",
            "7 Embraces",
            "The person is placed in the sitting position, and a companion receives her in an embrace: the facilitator or another companion helps by standing behind and holding her forehead gently and delicately placing his arms in a comfortable position. Symbolic: the progressive activation in a continuous affective context indicating that the world is pleased to welcome the person in it. The embrace is the most subtle and profound way to show welcoming and kindness This is the highlight moment of the reparenting process.",
            "8 Raise the person",
            "The person is raised into an upright position: before she is \"awakened\", a companion receives her in a standing embrace that contains and supports. The standing and sustained position is an invitation to gradually resume autonomy. Symbolically, it means that the matrix does not hold indefinitely, and that there is a sweet invitation to begin to put his feet on the ground, to regain verticality, to grow. The embrace must be very supportive, firm and soft at once. This is the phase where the person needs tutors to stand upright.",
            "The companions are still doing everything on her behalf.",
            "9 Restore identity through embraces",
            "A succession of profound and brief encounters takes place. When the person \"comes back to himself\", demonstrating some initiative in the encounters, we move to the next step. It symbolizes the growing autonomy and at the same time allows people in the group to show their support, their happiness to receive the friend who just returned from his trance. The succession of embraces contributes, in an affective climate, to restore the boundaries of identity and progressively access reciprocal gestures of affection and gratitude.",
            "This is a high moment of expanded reparenting and which prepares for a ritualized form of socialization. The person feels welcome and protected by all companions. The world is benevolent. This phase contributes significantly to the expansion of consciousness that the person may experience as vivencia while coming out of his trance, when he will open his eyes and meet the eyes of his companions. The embraces should be deep and increasingly shorter. Indeed, if the hug is too prolonged, there may be temptation to \"fall back\" into a trance, that is to say back in the matrix. The companions let him take more and more initiative in the embraces and in the changing of embraces.",
            "10 Prepare to discover the world",
            "The facilitator offers him one last brief embrace and shows him the world: the world are those present, that he can perceive in an essential way, beyond any appearance, beyond form. This phase symbolizes the welcoming into the human community of the person with its \"identity\" recovered. It is a time of very strong cohesion in the group and if the person was able to surrender, the people in the group are also able to have moments of expansion of consciousness. Indeed, the innocent look which is posed on each of the participants of the matrix reconnects them to their own innocence.",
            "11 Integrate the community",
            "The facilitator will integrate him to the human community represented by the circle. The facilitator presents the person at the center of the round, then integrates him into the circle, and then places himself close to the person in order to regulate the intensity of the movements of the group, by ensuring that euphoria can be experienced freely while taking into account the \"fragility\" of the person coming out of his trance.",
            "12 Celebration by the whole group",
            "The whole group celebrates. It is important that the whole group participates in this celebration, which is an essential moment of reparenting, as the person feels welcomed into the world, where she feels celebrated.",
            "The companions are invited to express their joy of receiving the newcomer in their community, and to celebrate themselves for having participated in the ceremony."
